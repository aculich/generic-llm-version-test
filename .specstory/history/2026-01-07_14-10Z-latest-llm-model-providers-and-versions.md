# Latest LLM model providers and versions (2026-01-07 14:10Z)

_**User (2026-01-07 14:05Z)**_

gemini3-flash.md is the file you should write your answer into: Tell me what the current latest versions of The top three LLM model providers are. What are the model names to pick from a selection. What are those latest Model names. and what version of the models Are they and what are they best for?

**Tracking Model Versions**

I'm focused on gathering the latest LLM model version data. Currently, I need to identify the top three providers, along with their model names, current versions, and intended use cases. The plan is to compile this information into a `gemini3-flash.md` file.


**Investigating Current Models**

I'm now diving into the specifics. My focus is on using web search to get January 2026 data. I'll need to create the `gemini3-flash.md` file, populating it with the LLM model specifics I find through the web search. I anticipate needing to refine my search queries to ensure I get the most precise and relevant details, including provider, model name, version, and intended uses.
