+ 
+ ## Key Findings
+ 
+ 1. **Model Versioning Patterns:**
+    - **Anthropic** uses date-based versioning (YYYYMMDD format) in model identifiers, making it easy to track specific releases
+    - **OpenAI** uses semantic versioning (e.g., gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo)
+    - **Google** uses version numbers (e.g., gemini-1.5-pro)
+    - **Stability AI** uses version numbers with variant suffixes (e.g., v1-0, v1-6)
+ 
+ 2. **Release Timeline:**
+    - **Oldest model:** dall-e-2 (April 2022)
+    - **Newest model:** claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 and claude-3-5-haiku-20241022 (October 22, 2024)
+    - Most models were released in 2023-2024, indicating active development
+ 
+ 3. **Default Model Selection:**
+    - All default models are relatively recent (2024 releases)
+    - Defaults appear to prioritize latest stable releases over older versions
+    - Image generation defaults to the latest DALL-E version (dall-e-3)
+ 
+ 4. **Code Quality Observations:**
+    - Model identifiers are properly parameterized, allowing easy updates
+    - Default models are clearly defined in a dictionary (lines 144-148 in &#96;query_llms.py&#96;)
+    - Documentation includes example model names for each provider
+    - Error handling is present for missing API keys and import errors
+ 
+ ## Recommendations
+ 
+ 1. **Version Pinning:** Consider pinning specific model versions (especially for Anthropic models) to ensure reproducible results across deployments.
+ 
+ 2. **Model Updates:** Regularly review and update default models to leverage latest capabilities:
+    - Check for newer Gemini models beyond 1.5-pro
+    - Monitor for GPT-4o updates or newer OpenAI models
+    - Watch for Anthropic Claude 3.5 updates beyond October 2024
+ 
+ 3. **Documentation:** The code already includes good inline documentation. Consider adding a CHANGELOG.md to track model updates.
+ 
+ 4. **Testing:** Ensure tests account for model availability and API changes, as models may be deprecated or updated.
+ 
+ ## Conclusion
+ 
+ The codebase uses a diverse set of modern LLM and image generation models from major providers. All default models are from 2024, indicating the code is using relatively current technology. The model identifiers are well-structured and allow for easy updates. The Anthropic models use date-based versioning which provides excellent traceability for specific model versions.
